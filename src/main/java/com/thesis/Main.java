We are building the back-end for a clinic appointment management system.
The system tracks doctors and appointments.


Definitions:
* A "doctor" has: doctorId, name.
* An "appointment" has: appointmentId, doctorId, patientId,
  durationMinutes, status, appointmentType.
* AppointmentStatus is one of: SCHEDULED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, NO_SHOW.
* AppointmentType is one of: CONSULTATION, FOLLOWUP, EMERGENCY.
* "ClinicManager" manages doctors, appointments, and provides statistics.


To begin with, we present you with two tasks:
1-1) Read through and understand the code below. Feel free to run it.
1-2) The test for ClinicManager is not passing due to a bug in the code.
     Make the necessary changes to ClinicManager to fix the bug.
*/
/*
We are extending the platform to report on appointment durations by type.


Recall that each Appointment carries an appointmentType, one of
CONSULTATION, FOLLOWUP, EMERGENCY.


Add a new function to the ClinicManager class:


2) The getAverageAppointmentDurationByType function should return a
   dictionary mapping each appointment type (CONSULTATION, FOLLOWUP,
   EMERGENCY) to the doctor's average appointment duration in minutes for
   that type. Only appointments with a COMPLETED status should be counted;
   ignore appointments with any other status. Only appointment types the
   doctor has at least one completed appointment for should appear in the
   dictionary. If the doctor has no completed appointments at all, return
   an empty dictionary.


To assist you in testing this new function, we have provided the
testGetAverageAppointmentDurationByType test.
